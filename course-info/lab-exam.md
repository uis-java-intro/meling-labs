###Lab Exam Information

The lab exam will be held in **Week 48**.
Exact day and time will be provided in a separate schedule.
 
1. Examination is individual and covers only lab 6 and 7. 

2. It is meant to be a demo session, where you show that your joint lab is
working, and you will be asked to run different parts of the program(s) that
you have developed, and we will also ask questions about the code.

3. Students are expected to know and be able to explain all the code in the
relevant lab exercises, even though your group partner wrote that particular
piece of code.

4. Your individual lab grade will be based on the lab handin and the lab exam.

5. Your grade will be announced at a later time after all students have
completed their lab exam.

6. If you have already passed the lab exam in a previous year, you do not need
to do the lab exercises again, if you only want to improve your written exam
grade. If you want to improve your lab grade, you will need to complete the lab 
exercises again. *Warning: It is a lot of work (as you know), and we may also 
change the lab exercises from one year to the next.*

7. Completing the lab exam is not a pre-requisite for attending the written
exam, but to get a final grade in the course, a passing grade is required for
both the lab exam and the written exam.


###Lab Exam Procedure

1. You are expected to come to the lab between 0700-0800 in morning of your
exam date to set up the necessary terminal windows and otherwise prepare things
so that each lab exercise can be executed with a few keystrokes. Make sure to
test that all is working correctly. Nothing should be running when you leave
the lab before 0800. Lock the screen and leave the room.
 
2. Please arrive about ten minutes before your scheduled time and wait outside
the lab. We will come and fetch you when it is your time.
 
3. The examination is expected to take about 20 minutes.
 
4. You will be asked questions about:
   - Your design and implementation for the two labs.
   - General theory questions about the two labs.
   - Questions about Go programming language features used in the labs.
   - General questions about kernel programming.
